To sum up, there are lots of ways to control the Pod placement, and choosing the right approach or combining multiple approaches can be overwhelming. The takeaway from this chapter is this: size and declare container resource profiles, and label Pods and nodes for the best resource-consumption-driven scheduling results. If that doesnâ€™t deliver the desired scheduling outcome, start with small and iterative changes. Strive for a minimal policy-based influence on the Kubernetes scheduler to express node dependencies and then inter-Pod dependencies.
